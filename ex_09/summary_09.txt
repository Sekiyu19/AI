1) Plot the results using “gnuplot”, and save the 3-D figure.

The name file should be “plot.png”, and the coordinates are as follows:

(X, Y, Z) = (v, r, b)

From the figure, try to describe the relation between b and (v, r).










2) Add the results for algorithm assignment here.
Slow = 1 - (|20 - Speed| / 20)
Normal = 1 - (|40 - Speed| / 20)
A little bit fast = 1 - (|60 - Speed| / 20)
Fast = 1 - (|80 - Speed| / 20)
